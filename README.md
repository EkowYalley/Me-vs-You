I throught throught the python Turtle library wanted to create a game that resembled snake and I decided to make to a one vs one because it would make it more engaging. Snake is a classic game that I had on my first phone, it came pre-installed, I found it fun and would play it for hours. I wanted to put a new twist on a classic game so I made it a multi player game building. I built it from a lot of reseources i found online and with my own personal knowledge of turtle and programing.
